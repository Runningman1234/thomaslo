        <p>As Robert Kennedy once said: "There are those that look at things the way they are, and ask why? 
           I dream of things that never were, and ask why not?"

           I'm one of those people that asks "why not?" 

           The three things I love in life are Entrepreneurship, Politics and its history, and exploring the world.
           
           Born and raised in Markham, Canada, I'm currently a Math/CPA student at the University of Waterloo. 
           I am an aspiring software developer, an accountant, a day trader, a public speaker, and an entrepreneur.</p>
        <p>While studying, working and travelling, I have been lucky enough to have had an enriching experience 
           having lived and studied in China, Hong Kong, United States, and Canada 
           and having studied over 5 languages (French, German, Spanish, Cantonese, and Mandarin)</p>

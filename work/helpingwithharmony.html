        <p>I was always passionate about music and learned piano and trumpet at a early age. In 2010, I found like-minded friends
        and together, we coordinated gala concerts to raise funds for the Markham Stouffville Hospital Foudation. The following year
        I decided to name our organization Helping with Harmony. To date, we have fundraised over $6000.</p>
